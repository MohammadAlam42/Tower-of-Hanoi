# Tower-of-Hanoi
The implementation of an algorithm to solve the famous Tower of Hanoi Problem using a recrusion-based algorithm. The program allows you to implement the algorithm with as many disks as desired and will tell you the exact moves needed to achieve moving the disks from one tower to the next


The program consists of two files: towersMain.C and towers.C. The program was run using a mate terminal whereby I compiled each file separately with the commands "gcc -c towersMain.c" and "gcc -c towers.C". After this, I created a command to link the two files and properly run the algorithm: "gcc -o towers towersMain.c towers.C". Now, the algorithm was run any time I typed "towers" into the mate terminal.
